_UW DevBlog_, a space for sharing best practices, ideas and tools with the UW–Madison campus developer community.

Initially, this will be a platform for [University Communications](http://uc.wisc.edu/) and [DoIT](http://www.doit.wisc.edu/)’s [Web and Mobile Solutions group](https://www.doit.wisc.edu/about/departments/#adi) to talk a little bit about the work we’re doing and how we do it. 


## In the Sandbox
In addition to using the blog to share ideas and tips, the blog itself is an excercise in learning and discovery. If you follow along, you’ll likely notice changes in design and code from time to time. 

At the moment this project is leveraging some of the tools that have become key components of our development process (and some of our initial posts here are about these tools):

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) (and [LESS](http://lesscss.org/))
* [Grunt]({% post_url 2013-10-4-grunt-build-tool %})
* [Jekyll]({% post_url 2013-10-07-introducing-jekyll %})

We're also using this project as a proving ground for our still in-development _UW–Madison UI toolkit_ based on Bootstrap (more to come on that soon.)

If you have an interest in learning about these tools, check out the [GitHub project](https://github.com/UWMadisonUcomm/devblog).

## How to participate
We want this effort to evolve into a space where other developers around campus can share some of their ideas and solutions to problems. 

If you’re interested in participating in _DevBlog_, please [get in touch](mailto:devblog@uc.wisc.edu) and let us know if you have an idea you’d like to contribute. 

If you’re comfortable with git and [Jekyll]({% post_url 2013-10-07-introducing-jekyll %}), you can contribute by forking our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/UWMadisonUcomm/devblog) and submitting your post as a pull request for us to review. If not, just [email us](mailto:devblog@uc.wisc.edu) and we'll work with you from there.
