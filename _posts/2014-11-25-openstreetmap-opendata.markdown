One of the exciting new features of [Mobile UW 2.0](http://mobile.wisc.edu) is the "new" maps.  By "new" I mean being able to take advantage the [UW Campus Map](http://www.map.wisc.edu) infrastructure that [UW Communications](http://uc.wisc.edu) built in 2013.

## What's So Exciting About This?
The UW campus is a constantly evolving place.  New buildings are being built and old buildings are being remodeled / repurposed all the time.  The UW campus is also a very large place with people from all around Wisconsin and the world visting on a daily basis.  Whether you're a seasoned traveller on campus or someone who's never been here before everyone at some point will need to be able to find their way around.  In order for UW to function it needs a mapping and wayfinding solution that keeps up with all the changes.

## So Why Not Just Use Google?
Google generally does do a pretty good job.  That said they aren't perfect.

Mobile UW has traditionally relied on Apple Maps for iOS and Google Maps for Android.
