Working with Bootstrap 2 a while ago, I noticed they were using an amazing web app for quickly creating placeholder images for their sample layouts: [http://placehold.it](http://placehold.it)

# What it does

[Placehold.it](http://placehold.it) helps you generate sample images on the fly, by simply adding an URL to `img` tags in your page. 

```html

<img src="placehold.it/400x200"/>

```
