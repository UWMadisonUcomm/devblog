Come join University Communications' web team on Friday, Dec. 20, 10-11:30 a.m. for our first ever **Web Office Hours**!


## What are Web Office Hours?

Web Office Hours are events where several of us with a wide range of skills and experience in web content, design and development will be available to help with any questions or challenges you're facing in your web-related work. 

Whether you'd like advice on how to approach a major redesign, pointers on how to address mobile and/or responsive web design, or help with that pesky, little CSS bug in IE8, we'll be there to help. Or if you don't have a specific need but just want to get together and offer your help to others, that would be great too.

Oh, and did I mention we'll have donuts and coffee? (Bet your professors never offered that.)


## Would like to participate? Drop us a line!

If you can, please [email Nick Weaver](mailto:jnweaver@wisc.edu) if you plan to come. Spontaneous visits are welcome too!

Thank you, and see you then!
