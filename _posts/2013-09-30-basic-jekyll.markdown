And so, in the world of bloated CMSs (we're looking at you, [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org)), a new alternative (re)emerges: plain-text driven static websites.

Enter [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a ruby-based, light-weight, markdown-friendly framework for creating static blogs and sites right in your favorite text editor.

## So what is it?
In a few words, Jekyll is a framework that helps you generate the static files you need for your site (HTML, CSS and JavaScript). By doing this, you avoid having your CMS build pages on the fly (like WordPress and Drupal), which can add processing time, make your site slow, and overall, run a bunch of crap that can make your site vulnerable.

## Features


- Markdown
  - You can use [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), a text-to-html converter, to write your posts. The beauty of markdown isn't only that it frees you from having to deal with HTML tags, but it makes your text editor become, well, a _text editor_.

- Basic templating
  - Jekyll supports (in fact, enforces) the use of templates to simplify the management of your files. 

- Liquid Markup
  - Need to generate some lists, include files, and add some conditionals? No problem: Jekyll uses [Liquid Markup](http://wiki.shopify.com/Liquid), a simple markuyp language that allows you to build simple structures and display content.

- No databases
  - Since your content is stores in static text files, you don't need to use databases. Isn't that neat?
